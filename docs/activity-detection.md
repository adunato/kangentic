# Activity Detection

Kangentic tracks whether each agent session is **thinking** (working on a turn), **idle** (waiting for input or done), or in a **permission** state (paused awaiting user approval). This drives the task card spinner, the desktop "task done" notification, idle-timeout suspend, and auto-focus behavior.

## Why this matters

The "task done" notification is one of Kangentic's core differentiators. Agents that have started backgrounded work (`Bash(run_in_background:true)`) are usually still working until those processes exit, even after the agent's hook stream has gone quiet. A session that prematurely shows "idle" causes a false notification; one that's stuck in "thinking" never notifies at all. Both are user-visible bugs.

"Usually", because a background shell can also be one the agent is merely OBSERVING rather than working through - `/preview`'s watcher blocks for hours on a service the user controls. Those opt out explicitly; see [Opting a background shell out of the hold](#opting-a-background-shell-out-of-the-hold).

This subsystem aims to be near-100% accurate: notification fires within seconds of the agent (and all its background work) actually being done.

## Key files

The engine itself is split across modules under `activity-engine/engine/`. External consumers import from `engine/index.ts`; internal modules are implementation details.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/index.ts` | Public surface re-exports (`ActivityEngine`, `ActivitySnapshotWriter`, types, default constants) |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/activity-engine.ts` | Engine class - lifecycle + orchestration (delegates to the modules below) |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/shapes.ts` | `SessionEngineState`, `ActivityEngineOptions`, `TransitionRecord`, `PendingTool`, event sets, default thresholds |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/predicate.ts` | Pure `derivePredicate` / `deriveReason` / `deriveActivityAndReason` - no engine reference, no mutation |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/event-handlers.ts` | Pure `updateCounters` / `updatePermissionFlag` - the big switch on event type |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/counter-snapshot.ts` | `snapshotCounters` and `formatCounterDelta` for the audit log |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/state-factory.ts` | `createSessionEngineState` initial-state factory |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/watchdog.ts` | `WatchdogHold` table + `findActiveWatchdogHold` lookup - declarative safety nets |
| `src/main/activity-engine/engine/snapshot-writer.ts` | `ActivitySnapshotWriter` - atomic JSON snapshots for post-mortem diagnostics |

Surrounding infrastructure:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/main/activity-engine/session-telemetry.ts` | Wires the engine to event ingestion + PTY tracker + watchers + user-interrupt coordinator |
| `src/main/activity-engine/user-interrupt-coordinator.ts` | 3-second settle timer for Ctrl+C; synthesizes Interrupted if engine still hot |

The events-path argument is either a literal path or the sentinel `env:<NAME>`, resolved from the hook process environment at run time - used by adapters whose CLI has no per-session settings mechanism (Grok): one static per-cwd hook file routes each session's events via that session's own spawn env, and a session without the variable (the user's own manual CLI run) is a silent no-op |
| `src/main/agent/adapters/claude/hook-manager.ts` | Claude Code hook configuration |
| `src/shared/types.ts` | `ActivityState`, `ActivityReason`, `EventType`, `SessionEvent.toolId` |

## ActivityState

```ts
type ActivityState = 'thinking' | 'idle' | 'permission';
```

Three top-level states:

- **`thinking`** - agent is working. Spinner shown on task card. Notifications NOT fired.
- **`idle`** - agent is truly done. Notification fires. Auto-focus / auto-suspend can act. The
  desktop notify decision (cooldown, focus gate, active-project gate, title assembly) is owned by
  `src/main/notifications/desktop-notifier.ts`, which listens to `SessionManager`'s own `activity`
  event directly rather than a renderer round-trip.
- **`permission`** - agent paused awaiting user approval. Distinct from `idle` so the UI can render a different affordance (lock icon vs idle dot).

## ActivityReason (discriminated union)

Every transition emits both an `ActivityState` AND an `ActivityReason` describing WHY:

```ts
type ActivityReason =
  | { kind: 'idle'; since: number }
  | { kind: 'permission'; since: number }
  | { kind: 'tool';            pendingCount: number; currentTool: string | null }
  | { kind: 'subagent';        depth: number }
  | { kind: 'background-shell'; count: number; ids: readonly string[] }
  | { kind: 'turn-active' };
```

`since` (epoch ms) is `SessionEngineState.needsUserSince`: when the session FIRST entered a
needs-user state. It spans both `idle` and `permission` - a `permission <-> idle` crossing keeps
the original park time rather than resetting it - and is cleared only on returning to `thinking`.
The renderer uses it to show elapsed wait time ("Idle for 12m") in the TaskCard hover tooltip
(`formatActivityReasonText` / `ActivityReasonTooltip` in
`src/renderer/components/board/ActivityReasonTooltip.tsx`).

The renderer uses `reason.kind` to pick an icon and inline label for the TaskCard hover tooltip. The
two kinds that describe agent activity itself render the shared `@kangentic/branding` activity marks
via `ActivityMark`, so they match the TaskCard indicator exactly (`idle` -> `agent-idle`,
`turn-active` -> `agent-working`); the kinds that name a specific cause have no counterpart in that
set and stay Lucide (`tool` -> Wrench, `subagent` -> Users, `background-shell` -> Terminal,
`permission` -> Lock).

### Durable activity-interval history

The engine's own state is in-memory only - `needsUserSince` (and every other field) is lost on
`deleteSession()` / app restart, and `events.jsonl` records raw hook events, not committed
transitions, so it is neither a faithful nor a reliably-retained substitute (a raw `idle` event
cancelled by the 400ms stability window still appears there with no matching state change, and a
watchdog-synthesized idle commits with no raw event at all).

`src/main/activity-engine/activity-interval-recorder.ts` durably records every committed
`ActivityDisposition` transition (`shared/activity-state.ts`'s `dispositionOf` - `'active'` for
`thinking`, `'idle'` for both `idle` and `permission`) to the per-project
`session_activity_intervals` table (migration in `src/main/db/migrations/project-schema.ts`,
alongside `conversation_turn_usage`), one row per interval (not per transition - a
`permission <-> idle` crossing shares the `'idle'` disposition, so it does not close and reopen a
row). Symmetric by design: both dispositions are recorded directly rather than deriving "active
time" as the inverse of "idle time", which would need exact session-boundary reconciliation
across resumes/suspends and would silently break on a crash-orphaned open row. Each row carries
the engine's own `enter_trigger` / `exit_trigger` labels, so a consumer can distinguish a
hook-authoritative park (`event:idle`) from a watchdog guess (`timer:stale-thinking`), and a
genuine human reply (`event:prompt`) from the agent resuming itself
(`event:prompt:pty-activity`, `force-thinking`). `started_ms`/`ended_ms` (epoch integers, used by
the `duration_ms` arithmetic and the `started_ms` index) are mirrored by `started_at`/`ended_at`
(TEXT UTC ISO 8601, per `.claude/rules/utc-timestamps.md`) - the store derives the mirror from the
same value it writes to the `_ms` column, so the two can never drift. Read via the
`kangentic_get_activity_intervals` MCP tool (see `docs/mcp-server.md`) or `kangentic_query_db`. No
desktop-facing IPC endpoint exists yet.

Priority ladder: `permission > tool > subagent > background-shell > turn-active > idle`. Anchored to `state.activity` for consistency - when forced paths (Interrupted, forceIdle) commit a transition that diverges from the bare predicate (e.g. clearing all counters on Esc), the reason follows the committed state.

## EventType reference

The 24 `EventType` values written to `events.jsonl` by `event-bridge.js`, defined in `src/shared/types.ts`. The activity column shows how each event maps to `ActivityState` via the `EventTypeActivity` table, also in `src/shared/types.ts`.

| EventType key | JSONL value | Activity mapping | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| `Prompt` | `prompt` | `thinking` | User submitted a prompt; agent is starting a turn |
| `ToolStart` | `tool_start` | `thinking` | Agent began invoking a tool |
| `ToolEnd` | `tool_end` | log-only | Tool returned; counters update and `lastSignalAt` refreshes (a `PostToolUse` hook proves the agent is alive, so `tool_end` is NOT in the engine's `LOG_ONLY_EVENTS` set), but the activity state does not change |
| `Idle` | `idle` | `idle` | Agent finished its turn (Stop hook, prompt-regex, or silence timer) |
| `Interrupted` | `interrupted` | `idle` | User pressed Esc / Ctrl+C; clears counters and commits idle |
| `TurnFailed` | `turn_failed` | `idle` | Turn aborted by a TERMINAL service/API error (Claude's `StopFailure` hook, which fires instead of `Stop`); `detail` carries the error type (e.g. `authentication_error`). Routed through the Interrupted bypass: clears counters and commits idle immediately (see "Aborted-turn recovery") |
| `TurnRetrying` | `turn_retrying` | conditional idle | `StopFailure` fired for a TRANSIENT, auto-retried error (overloaded/server_error/rate_limit/api_error), classified at the source (like `IdleHint`). Holds the session `thinking` through a live retry (preserving `subagentDepth` and deferring to the stale-thinking or stuck-subagent watchdog); idles immediately if the turn had already wound down or ended (see "Aborted-turn recovery") |
| `SessionStart` | `session_start` | log-only | Session began; carries adapter session metadata |
| `SessionEnd` | `session_end` | log-only | Session ended (CLI process exited) |
| `SubagentStart` | `subagent_start` | `thinking` | Main agent spawned a child agent |
| `SubagentStop` | `subagent_stop` | log-only | Subagent returned; depth counter decrements - EXCEPT an empty-string `detail` ("") which is a spurious inner-loop stop and is ignored (see "Subagent depth") |
| `Notification` | `notification` | log-only | Informational notification from the agent |
| `IdleHint` | `idle_hint` | conditional idle | "Waiting for your input" notification, classified at the source. Ends the turn only when no other holder remains; otherwise log-only (see "Idle hints" below) |
| `Compact` | `compact` | `thinking` | Context-window compaction in progress |
| `TeammateIdle` | `teammate_idle` | log-only | Cross-agent teammate signaled idle |
| `TaskCompleted` | `task_completed` | log-only | Agent declared the task finished |
| `ConfigChange` | `config_change` | log-only | Agent settings/model changed mid-session |
| `WorktreeCreate` | `worktree_create` | `thinking` | Agent created a git worktree |
| `WorktreeRemove` | `worktree_remove` | log-only | Agent removed a git worktree |
| `BackgroundShellStart` | `background_shell_start` | `thinking` | `Bash(run_in_background: true)` launched, a foreground Bash auto-backgrounded on timeout (its `tool_response` carries a shell id), or a `Monitor` wait promoted via its `tool_response.taskId` |
| `BackgroundShellEnd` | `background_shell_end` | log-only | `KillBash` invoked, a watcher-inferred natural exit, or the watcher's transcript drain observing a tracked shell's terminal `<task-notification>` directly in the durable session transcript; decrements active-shells counter |
| `ModelStart` | `model_start` | log-only | LLM API call beginning (Qwen/Gemini per-call telemetry) |
| `ModelEnd` | `model_end` | log-only | LLM API call returned |
| `ToolSelectionStart` | `tool_selection_start` | log-only | Agent is choosing the next tool |

"log-only" means the event is recorded for the activity feed and may update internal counters, but does not on its own change `ActivityState`. State changes only occur through the predicate (see below) or via direct `Idle` / `Interrupted` events.

### Idle hints (waiting-for-input notifications)

Some turns end without a `Stop`/`Idle` hook ever reaching the main agent - most commonly when the whole turn was delegated to a subagent. When the subagent stops, `subagentDepth → 0` but `turnActive` is still `true`, and the only thing that arrives is a `Notification` ("Claude is waiting for your input"). Because `Notification` is log-only, nothing clears `turnActive`, and the session stays `thinking` until the 180s stale-thinking watchdog fires - the user sees the spinner spin ~3 minutes after the agent is actually done.

`idle_hint` closes that gap. The classification happens **at the source, not in the engine**: the Claude adapter's `Notification` hook carries a generic `setTypeWhenDetailContains('waiting for your input', EventType.IdleHint)` directive (the only Claude-specific string), so `event-bridge.js` rewrites the matching notification's `type` to `idle_hint`. The match runs on the already-extracted `detail` text (empirically "Claude is waiting for your input"), so it does not depend on which payload field carried the message. The engine never string-matches notification text and never branches on agent name.

The engine treats `idle_hint` as **conditionally** turn-ending (`idleHintEndsTurn` in `predicate.ts`): it clears `turnActive` only when `turnActive && pendingToolCount === 0 && subagentDepth === 0 && bgShellCount === 0 && !permissionPending`. When the guard passes, the predicate flips to idle through the normal 400ms stability window (near-instant for the user). When it fails - tools, subagents, or background shells still outstanding, or a permission pending - `idle_hint` does NOT clear `turnActive` (a notification that fires mid-turn never short-circuits genuine work), but it is no longer a complete no-op: it sets `idleHintPending`, which shortens the stuck-subagent and stuck-pending-tools watchdogs (see "Aborted-turn recovery" below). `idle_hint` is in `LOG_ONLY_EVENTS`, so it never resets `lastSignalAt` (a failed guard leaves the genuine work's watchdog anchor untouched).

**Why the substring is deliberately narrow.** A scan of 221 real Claude sessions surfaced exactly four distinct notification texts: "Claude is waiting for your input" (794x), "Claude Code needs your approval for the plan" (109x), "Claude Code needs your attention" (43x), and "Claude needs your permission[ to use X]" (51x). Only the first fires for a pure turn-end whose `Stop` hook can be dropped. The other three each fire ~6s AFTER a `PermissionRequest` (tool permission, ExitPlanMode plan approval, or AskUserQuestion) has already driven the engine to the `permission` state, so they are correctly left log-only - reclassifying any of them would conflate `permission` with `idle`. The negative cases are pinned with the real strings in `tests/unit/event-bridge-remap.test.ts`.

Only the Claude adapter wires this today, because Claude is the only agent for which we have captured evidence (a real session) of both the notification text and the dropped-Stop failure mode (a turn fully delegated to a subagent). The engine path is generic: any adapter that classifies a notification into `idle_hint` gets the same behavior.

To extend it to another hook-based agent, capture a real session that exhibits the stall, read the notification's extracted `detail`, then add a `setTypeWhenDetailContains('<observed substring>', EventType.IdleHint)` directive (built via the typed builder in that adapter's hook-manager, never hand-authored) to that adapter's Notification hook. Do not guess the string. Current status of the other agents:

- **Gemini / Qwen Code** share the same hook shape (`AfterAgent` -> `idle` stop-equivalent, `Notification` -> `notification`), so they could be susceptible. But they wire no `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` hooks, so the subagent-delegation failure mode is not modeled, and we have no captured session to confirm their notification text. Wire only after capturing evidence.
- **Kimi** does not need this: its wire protocol emits an explicit `TurnEnd -> Idle`, and none of its `Notification`-mapped messages mean "waiting for input."
- **Codex / Copilot / OpenCode** wire no Notification hook, so the pattern cannot apply.

### Aborted-turn recovery (service errors)

When a service/API error (rate limit, overload, server error) disrupts a turn, a subagent's NAMED terminal `subagent_stop` or a tool's `tool_end` can be lost, so `subagentDepth` or `pendingToolCount` stays > 0 and the board shows the task `thinking` while the agent is actually parked at the prompt. There are three distinct failure modes, and a layer for each.

**Layer A - the idle-hint-shortened watchdog (the validated fix for #277).** In the captured #277 incident the stuck counter came from a subagent whose named stop was dropped, while the **parent turn kept running normally** - each later turn ended with a real `Stop` (an `idle` event, swallowed by the stuck counter) plus an `idle_hint`, and **no `StopFailure` was ever emitted** (the `idle` events confirm the turns ended via `Stop`, not an abort). To recover this, an `idle_hint` ("waiting for your input") arriving while a counter is still stuck > 0 sets `idleHintPending`, which drops the `stuck-subagent` and `stuck-pending-tools` holds from the 5-min `bgShellEscapeHatchMs` cap to the validated stale-thinking budget (`staleAfterIdleHintMs`, default 180s). The hold **anchor is unchanged** (`signal-or-pty-output`): a top-level `idle_hint` can fire while a subagent is genuinely live (the notification fires outside the main agentic loop - task #237 / session-018), so this only shortens the timer; a live subagent keeps streaming PTY output, which defers it, and its named stops arrive while it works. `idleHintPending` is cleared by the next turn-initiating event and by any reset (bypass / force-*), and is surfaced on `ActivityStatsSnapshot` for the debug overlay.

**Layer B - the structured `StopFailure` signal, terminal case.** A *different* mode is a turn that an API error terminates outright: Claude Code fires a `StopFailure` hook *instead of* `Stop` (`code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks`, added in CLI 2.1.78), so that turn's closing hooks never run. The Claude adapter's hook-manager wires `StopFailure` to emit `turn_failed` by default, carrying the error type (Claude's `error` / `error_details` fields) in `detail`. The engine treats `turn_failed` like `Interrupted` (it is in `TURN_ENDING_EVENTS` and routes through `applyInterruptedBypass`): all counters reset and the session commits idle immediately, with the error type preserved in the transition trigger (`event:turn_failed:<error>`) - distinct from a user-`Esc` `interrupted`.

**Layer C - the structured `StopFailure` signal, TRANSIENT case (`turn_retrying`).** Claude Code also fires `StopFailure` for a **transient, auto-retried** error - 529 overloaded / `server_error` / `rate_limit` / `api_error` - not only a final abort. During the retry backoff the turn is still alive, but before this layer the engine treated every `StopFailure` identically (Layer B's immediate `applyInterruptedBypass`), force-idling a task mid-retry with no safety net to revive it (no PTY output, no output-token growth during backoff). Confirmed empirically by replaying the real captured `events.jsonl` from kangentic.com Task #43 (session `fc2f1446`) through the actual `ActivityEngine`: the committed disposition was `idle` for the whole ~166s retry window, driven by `event:turn_failed:server_error`.

The fix classifies the error at the **source, not the engine** (mirroring the `IdleHint` precedent): the Claude adapter's `StopFailure` directive reclassifies a transient error's already-extracted `detail` into the generic `turn_retrying` event via chained `setTypeWhenDetailContains` directives (`overloaded`, `server_error`, `rate_limit`, `api_error`), leaving `turn_failed` for everything else. The engine then decides liveness with `idleHintPending` as the discriminator (the same field Layer A uses) - this is what keeps Layer B's #277 fixture correct while fixing the new bug:

- **Live retry** (`!idleHintPending && turnActive`, e.g. an open tool/subagent, no preceding "waiting for input"): `applyRetryableFailureHold` resets the in-flight counters (decoupled cleanup, same reset as `applyInterruptedBypass`) EXCEPT `subagentDepth` (see Layer D), and KEEPS `turnActive`, so the session stays `thinking`. `turn_retrying` is NOT in `LOG_ONLY_EVENTS`, so each retry refreshes `lastSignalAt` - the watchdog therefore fires from the LAST retry (not the first), only if the turn genuinely never resumes. A backoff shorter than the threshold (the fc2f1446 incident's gap was ~148s) never false-idles.
- **Wound-down or already-ended turn** (`idleHintPending`, e.g. session-019's shape, or `!turnActive`): treated exactly like a terminal `turn_failed` - `applyInterruptedBypass` idles immediately.

**Preventing a parked-repaint regression (#294/#364 class).** During a live-retry hold, neither existing "believed parked" signal (`idleHintPending`, `turnForcedByHeartbeat`) is set, so the holding watchdog would keep its `signal-or-pty-output` anchor - a parked-TUI "retrying in Ns..." repaint streams real PTY bytes and would defer the net forever if the error turns out to be terminal. `applyRetryableFailureHold` sets a provenance flag, `retryFailurePending`, added to `watchdogBaseTime`'s `believedParked` check alongside the other two, so the hold narrows to its `signal` anchor during a retry hold exactly as it does for `idleHintPending`. Cleared by the same events that clear `idleHintPending`: a genuine turn-initiating event, the bypass/hold reset, and `forceThinking`/`forceIdle`.

**Layer D - preserving `subagentDepth` across a live retry (#532).** Layer C's shared reset also zeroed `subagentDepth`, which is wrong for a live hold: a rate-limit retry does not kill live subagents. They survive the parent's API retry and self-heal through their own terminal `SubagentStop`. And because the decrement is clamped (`Math.max(0, depth - 1)`), those stops could never restore the count - once wiped, the depth was pinned at 0 for the rest of the session and every later `idle` / `idle_hint` sailed through the `subagentDepth === 0` turn-ending gate. In the captured incident (task #527, session `7faa4308`), 11 turn-enders were let through while 2 to 11 subagents were live, and the durable `activity_intervals` rows were mis-recorded with them.

This surfaced now because Claude Code dispatches Agent subagents in the **background**: `PreToolUse` to `PostToolUse` averaged 1.7s on that session while the agents lived 2 to 19 minutes. The parent's own `Stop` therefore routinely arrives with agents still live, and `subagentDepth` is the only signal keeping the board honest during that window.

`resetInFlightCounters` takes a `preserveSubagentDepth` option, defaulting OFF so `applyInterruptedBypass` is unchanged (whether background agents survive an Esc or a terminal `turn_failed` is unverified, so it stays out of scope). `pendingToolCount` / `pendingToolStack` are deliberately still cleared - the same shape of loss, but weaker (the count is not in the predicate, and the turn-ending gate keys only on `subagentDepth`), and restoring the count without its id-matched stack would leave arriving `tool_end`s unable to match.

Preserving the depth changes WHICH watchdog arbitrates a retry hold: every other hold requires `subagentDepth === 0`, so `stuck-subagent` (5-min cap) takes over from `stale-thinking` (180s). That hold had no `parkedAnchor`, which would have reopened the parked-repaint hole above. It now carries `parkedAnchor: 'signal'` plus a `parkedWhen` predicate narrowing the parked test to `retryFailurePending` alone - `idleHintPending` must NOT narrow this hold, because an idle_hint can fire while a subagent is genuinely live (#237 / session-018) and there the streaming output must keep deferring it. The narrowing is safe because every real work signal disengages it: `tool_start` / `subagent_start` are turn-initiating (they clear `retryFailurePending`), and `tool_end` is deliberately not log-only, so it refreshes the narrowed `signal` anchor itself. Only a wedged CLI emitting nothing but repaints is left to the 5-min cap.

Empirical basis: task #277 (session `27582968`) held `thinking` for ~560s after the agent was idle; the condensed stream is pinned in `tests/fixtures/replay/session-019-service-error-stuck-subagent.jsonl` (its "without turn_failed" assertion reproduces the real stuck-thinking bug). Task #43 (session `fc2f1446`) held `idle` for ~166s during a live API retry; the condensed stream is pinned in `tests/fixtures/replay/session-023-false-idle-server-error-retry.jsonl`. Task #527 (session `7faa4308`) showed ~103s of false idle in one of 11 such windows while its Code Review agent worked; that shape is pinned in `tests/fixtures/replay/session-028-turn-retrying-wipes-subagent-depth.jsonl`. The timer-driven recovery for all three (which the fast-time replay harness cannot advance) is covered in `tests/unit/activity-engine.test.ts` ("aborted/errored-turn recovery" and "turn_retrying").

## ActivityDetectionStrategy variants

Each adapter declares one strategy via its `runtime.activity` field (constructed through the `ActivityDetection` factory). The three variants:

| Kind | Hooks fire? | PTY fallback? | Used by | Semantics |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| `hooks` | Yes (sole source of truth) | No | Claude Code | Activity state is driven exclusively by hook deliveries. PTY traffic is ignored for state transitions. |
| `pty` | No | Yes | Aider, Cursor, Warp, Droid, Codex, Kimi, Ollama, Pi, OMP (today) | No hook protocol available. The PTY tracker emits `forceIdle` after a silence window, optionally short-circuited by an adapter-supplied `detectIdle(data)` regex that matches the agent's input prompt. Kimi gets authoritative `TurnBegin`/`TurnEnd` transitions from `runtime.sessionHistory` (wire.jsonl), not the hook pipeline. |
| `hooks_and_pty` | Yes (primary) | Yes (fallback) | Gemini, Qwen, OpenCode, Copilot, Grok, Antigravity | Hooks are authoritative when they fire; the PTY tracker is auto-suppressed on the first hook event and re-engages only if hooks stop arriving. For Grok the fallback is load-bearing by design: its project hooks are folder-trust-gated and silently skipped in an untrusted directory, so the PTY tracker carries activity until trust lands. Antigravity's hook events are `prompt` (PreInvocation), `tool_end` (PostToolUse), and `idle` (Stop); its hooks never fire in `-p` print mode, where the PTY fallback (silence timer + the `? for shortcuts` idle-footer regex) carries detection. |

Both `pty` and `hooks_and_pty` may pass an optional `detectIdle(data: string) => boolean` for instant idle detection from the input-prompt regex. Without it, idle is inferred from a silence timer.

## Predicate

The engine exposes ONE predicate:

```
'thinking' IFF turnActive
            OR subagentDepth > 0
            OR (activeBackgroundShellIds.size + anonymousBackgroundShellCount) > 0
'permission' IFF permissionPending
'idle' otherwise
```

Notably absent: `pendingToolCount` is NOT in the predicate. An explicit `Idle` event (Stop hook) must transition to idle even if a tool's PostToolUse never arrived. `pendingToolCount` only drives the `'tool'` reason for UI tooltips.

Also absent, and deliberately so: `exemptBackgroundShellIds`. See [Opting a background shell out of the hold](#opting-a-background-shell-out-of-the-hold).

### turnActive

Set on any "thinking-initiating" event (`ToolStart`, `Prompt`, `SubagentStart`, `Compact`, `WorktreeCreate`, `BackgroundShellStart`). Cleared by `Interrupted`, and by `Idle` **only when `subagentDepth === 0`** (an `Idle` arriving while a subagent is live is the subagent's own inner Stop and must not end the parent turn - see [Subagent depth](#subagent-depth)). Also re-armed when a permission pause resolves (see [Permission flag](#permission-flag)). Persists across the silent gaps between tool calls so the spinner doesn't flicker.

### Subagent depth

Tracks nested subagent invocations. `SubagentStart` increments; a `SubagentStop` decrements (clamped to 0), **except a `SubagentStop` whose `detail` is the empty string `""`, which is ignored** (it bumps the `ignoredInnerSubagentStop` compensation counter instead). A subagent runs synchronously inside the parent's turn, so when its inner loop finishes it fires a `Stop` hook (mapped to `Idle`) **while it is still tracked as live**. That `Idle` is the subagent's, not the parent's: the engine therefore does NOT clear the parent's `turnActive` when `subagentDepth > 0` (the parent is blocked on / about to consume the subagent result and has not finished).

The parent's own Stop **used** to arrive only after every subagent had returned (i.e. at `subagentDepth === 0`). That is no longer true. Claude Code now dispatches Agent subagents in the **background**: measured on session `7faa4308`, `PreToolUse` to `PostToolUse` for the Agent tool averaged **1.7s** while the agents themselves lived 2 to 19 minutes. The parent's turn ends, the agents keep working, and the main loop is auto-re-invoked on completion with no user action. So a parent `Stop` now routinely arrives with agents live, and `subagentDepth` is the **only** signal keeping the board honest during that window - which is why losing it (task #532, see Layer D above) produced multi-minute false idles rather than a cosmetic glitch.

Why the empty-string skip: a real capture (session `87524f38`, task #234 running 3 parallel `Explore` agents then a `Plan` agent) showed every subagent emit **two** stops - a spurious empty-detail (`detail: ""`) inner-loop stop when its inner turn ends, then its authoritative **named** terminal stop (`detail: "Explore"` / `"Plan"`) when the Task tool returns. Counting the empty inner stops drove `subagentDepth` to 0 while subagents were still live, so a later real `Idle` (an Explore inner stop) or `idle_hint` ("waiting for your input", the ~69s Plan window) ended the parent turn early - the board went idle for the tail of the run (task #237, the inverse of a false-active). Ignoring the empty-string inner stops keeps `subagentDepth` accurate so the depth-0 gates above do their job. The guard is strictly `detail === ''`: a detail-**less** stop (no `detail` field, e.g. `session-008`'s hand-crafted stream) and a named stop are real terminal stops and still decrement. Pinned by the `session-017-false-idle-during-live-subagent` (the earlier ordering) and `session-018-parallel-subagent-false-idle` (the harder ordering, this fix) replay fixtures; the raw hook payloads confirm a subagent-context Stop carries `agent_id` while the main-agent Stop does not.

### Background-shell tracking (Set + anonymous fallback)

Two storage modes:

- **`activeBackgroundShellIds: Set<string>`** - shells tracked by their assigned `shell_id`. This is the normal steady state. A `Bash(run_in_background: true)` fires the hook TWICE: PreToolUse has no id yet (Claude has not assigned one), then PostToolUse carries the id in `tool_response.shellId` and the adapter remaps that event to `background_shell_start` too. The engine treats the second arrival as a PROMOTION, converting one anonymous slot into a named entry so the total never double-counts. `markBackgroundShellEnded(sessionId, shellId)` removes the matching id.
- **`anonymousBackgroundShellCount: number`** - the sub-second window before that promotion, plus any shell whose id never arrives (a dropped PostToolUse, or a hook chain that only fires one side). The watcher's count-based heuristic decrements this.

The predicate uses `set.size + anonymousCount > 0` so both modes coexist.

Which mode a start-event lands in is decided purely by the SHAPE of its `detail` (`looksLikeShellId`): id-shaped (1-64 chars of `[\w-]`) is named, anything else - typically the long command string Claude falls back to at PreToolUse - is anonymous.

### Opting a background shell out of the hold

A third set, **`exemptBackgroundShellIds: Set<string>`**, holds shells that declared themselves NON-HOLDING. The predicate never sums it, so those shells contribute nothing to activity.

This exists because the engine cannot distinguish two genuinely different things that produce identical events. A background `npm install` is real agent work and must hold the session active. `/preview`'s exit watcher is a user-facing service the agent is only observing, and it blocks for the preview's entire lifetime - hours. Both are alive, both are correctly detected. Only the CALLER knows which is which, so the caller says so by putting `NO_ACTIVITY_HOLD_FLAG` (`--kangentic-no-activity-hold`, defined in `src/shared/background-shell-hold.ts`) in the command it launches:

```
node scripts/worktree-preview.js --wait --port=5174 --kangentic-no-activity-hold
```

Mechanics, and why they are shaped this way:

- The flag rides in `tool_input.command`, which the PreToolUse hook already surfaces as the event `detail`. No new hook, no registry file, no extra IPC.
- The exemption is recorded at PreToolUse against the event's `toolId` (`pendingExemptShellToolIds`), because the anonymous-to-named promotion is a detail-shape heuristic with no `toolId` correlation of its own, and the flag CANNOT be re-read at PostToolUse - that event's detail is the shell id, and the command string is gone. A start with no `toolId` is never exempted; that particular miss fails toward a shell that keeps holding (today's behavior) rather than a false idle.
- That memo must survive a turn end. The two events are ~1.7s apart, so an `Interrupted` or `TurnFailed` can land between them; if the reset dropped the memo, the arriving PostToolUse would have no record of the exemption and would file the still-running shell in the HOLDING set, pinning the session thinking for the preview's whole lifetime. `resetInFlightCounters` therefore leaves BOTH the memo and `exemptBackgroundShellIds` alone (the CLI process is still alive on every one of its callers), and `MAX_PENDING_EXEMPT_SHELL_TOOL_IDS` is what bounds the memo instead. Pinned by the `mid-promotion` replay case.
- The flag is matched as a plain substring of the command, so it is not proof the shell IS the preview watcher: any background command whose text happens to contain the literal (a `grep` for it over this repo, say) is also exempted. The blast radius is one shell, which stays fully tracked for liveness and simply does not hold activity, and no foreground command is affected. Tightening this to an argv-token match would not close it either, since the realistic collisions pass the flag as a delimited argument.
- Exempt shells are excluded from the PREDICATE, not from TRACKING. `session-telemetry.ts`'s `getActiveShellCount` and `getNamedShellIds` sum both sets, so Tier A PID capture, liveness confirmation, the transcript drain, and the `expected = preExistingHelpers + tracked` deficit math all keep working, and the shell drains normally when the preview exits. Dropping an exempt id from `tracked` while its process is alive would take the watcher's surplus branch and permanently fold a real process into the helper baseline.
- Because a separate set is invisible to the predicate's sum, an exempt shell also RE-ARMS the three watchdog holds that gate on that sum being zero (stuck-pending-tools, stale-thinking, stuck-subagent). Intended: an exempt shell must behave exactly as if it did not exist.
- Nothing persists across an app restart, and nothing needs to. A resumed session's history reader starts at EOF, so neither start event replays and the engine's bg-shell state simply begins empty.

The flag is agent-typed (an agent wrote the command string), which puts it on the same trust boundary as every other hook-sourced field here.

Pinned by the `session-027-preview-watcher-holds-active` / `-exempt` replay fixture pair (byte-identical but for the flag, opposite outcomes) and `tests/unit/no-activity-hold-sentinel-parity.test.ts`, which keeps the flag's three hand-duplicated copies (the TS constant, `scripts/worktree-preview.js`, and `.claude/skills/preview/SKILL.md`) in sync.

### Permission flag

Set when an `Idle` event fires with `detail: 'permission'`. The engine also records `permissionAwaitedToolId` - the correlation id at the top of `pendingToolStack`, i.e. the tool the prompt was raised for (permission prompts fire between PreToolUse and execution, and permission idles leave the stack intact). Cleared by:
- `Prompt` (user typed something new)
- `Interrupted` (Esc)
- `SubagentStart` (main agent spawning a child)
- `Idle` with non-permission detail (agent ended turn)
- `ToolStart`/`ToolEnd` at `subagentDepth === 0` (main agent activity)
- `ToolStart`/`ToolEnd` carrying `permissionAwaitedToolId`, at ANY depth (the prompt was approved and that exact tool ran - e.g. a tool inside a subagent; without this the flag stays stuck until the subagent stops, since the PTY net deliberately exempts `'permission'`)

Unrelated subagent-tool events at depth>0 (different or absent toolId) do NOT clear permission (parallel-subagent tool churn must not dismiss a prompt that is still awaiting approval). The approved-tool clear is pinned by the `session-010` replay fixture (task #194's stuck 77s window).

**Resume restores `turnActive`.** A permission pause begins with `Idle{detail:'permission'}`, which clears `turnActive` (Idle is a turn-ending event). When the pause resolves, the wake is typically a depth-0 `ToolEnd` (e.g. the `AskUserQuestion` / `ExitPlanMode` tool ending after the user answers/approves) - a non-turn-initiating event that clears `permissionPending` but does not re-arm `turnActive`. The resumed turn emits no fresh `Prompt`/`ToolStart` hook, so without intervention the predicate would see no holder and drop to **idle** until the PTY force-thinking net catches up seconds later. To avoid that, `processEvent` restores `turnActive = true` whenever `permissionPending` transitions `true -> false` on a non-turn-ending event (i.e. not `Idle`/`Interrupted`, which are genuine end-of-turn). This is classified by the generic permission-clear shape, not by tool or agent name, so it covers every permission-class pause. Pinned by the `session-006`/`session-007` replay fixtures.

### Tool tracking (stack with correlation IDs + LIFO-by-name fallback)

`pendingToolStack: Array<{ id?: string; name: string }>` records in-flight tools in start order. `currentTool` always reflects the top of the stack and is exposed via `ActivityReason` for the TaskCard hover tooltip ("Running Bash").

ToolEnd matching priority:
1. **By correlation id** - when both events carry `event.toolId` (Claude's `tool_use_id` extracted via the `extractToolId` directives, top-level and nested), exact removal regardless of stack position. Solves the duplicate-name and out-of-order cases.
2. **LIFO-by-name** - fallback when an event has no toolId or the id didn't match (drift recovery from hook drop or version skew).
3. **Raw pop** - fallback for `Interrupted` (no tool name carried).

Hard reset on `pendingToolCount === 0`: the stack is cleared even if name desync left dangling entries. Idle events also clear the stack (see "Idle clamp" below).

Adapters opt into ID correlation by adding `extractToolId(['<field>'])` and `extractToolId(['<field>'], { nested: '<parent>' })` directives to their hook config. Adapters without correlation IDs leave `event.toolId` undefined and the engine falls back to LIFO-by-name automatically - no breaking change.

### Idle clamp

When a non-permission `Idle` event arrives, the engine forcibly clears `pendingToolCount`, the stack, and `currentTool`. The agent's turn is done; any unmatched ToolStart events are stale by definition (PostToolUse hook dropped, tool force-killed, etc.).

Permission idles bypass the clamp because the agent paused awaiting approval and may resume the same tool.

## Stability window (400ms)

When the predicate flips from `thinking` to `idle` due to a Stop event or a counter clearing, the engine waits 400ms before emitting the transition. If a thinking signal arrives during the window, the pending idle is cancelled. Prevents `idle → thinking → idle` flicker from out-of-order hook arrivals.

Bypassed by:
- `Interrupted` (Esc - instant, no flicker concern)
- `forceIdle` (PTY-driven; already debounced 3s in PtyActivityTracker)
- Stale-thinking watchdog (already 180s)

Configurable via `ActivityEngineOptions.idleStabilityWindowMs`. Tests set this to 0 for deterministic timing.

## Five safety nets (the watchdog table)

The predicate handles the common case. Five timer-driven safety nets in `engine/watchdog.ts` catch hook-loss / orphan situations. Each is a `WatchdogHold` describing a state shape, threshold, timer anchor (a `WatchdogAnchor`: which timestamp the deadline is measured from), reset action, and audit-log label. `findActiveWatchdogHold(state, holds)` picks the matching one each cycle (first match wins).

### 1. Named bg-shell sole-holder cap (5 min)

Once the turn is over and a NAMED background shell (`activeBackgroundShellIds`, declared by a `background_shell_start` hook with a shell_id) is the only holder of `thinking`, the engine reclaims it at the long 5-min cap (`timer:bg-shell-hatch`). A named shell is positive evidence of real agent-initiated work, so absence of watcher confirmation must EXTEND, not shorten, the hold. It is reclaimed sooner by positive exit evidence (a `BackgroundShellEnd` event or a Tier A PID death) or held active indefinitely by the watcher confirming its PID alive each cycle (`markBackgroundShellsAlive`, see below). The reset clears the bg-shell counters and emits idle through the stability window.

The deadline is anchored to when bg shells became the sole holder (`bgShellHoldSince`; `anchor: 'bg-shell-hold-since'`), NOT to `lastSignalAt`. An earlier design had the watcher refresh `lastSignalAt` every 2s while it saw any shell-like descendant; for an orphan whose exit the watcher could not attribute, that pulse pushed the deadline out forever and pinned the session `active` indefinitely (tasks #175/#180). Anchoring to the hold-start makes the deadline immovable by signal-only keep-alives; only watcher-confirmed liveness (`markBackgroundShellsAlive`) advances it. The original design used a single 30s grace for ALL bg shells, which false-idled a genuinely-running 10-min E2E at turn end when the watcher could not confirm it alive (tasks #210/#212); splitting named (5-min cap, Tier A liveness) from anonymous (30s grace) fixed that.

### 2. Anonymous bg-shell sole-holder grace (30s)

When only ANONYMOUS bg shells (`anonymousBackgroundShellCount`, no shell_id) hold `thinking` and the turn is over, the engine reclaims them after a short 30s grace (also `timer:bg-shell-hatch`). Anonymous shells are heuristic adoptions (resume-time descendants with no `background_shell_start` hook), so fast reclaim stays correct. Same anchor (`'bg-shell-hold-since'`) and reset as the named cap; only the threshold differs. The watcher's attributed drain (`onNaturalExit`, ~4s) still wins for clean exits; the grace is the backstop for the unattributable case.

### 3. Stale-thinking watchdog (180s)

Held by `turnActive` alone (no tools, no subagent, no bg shells) for 180 seconds. The matching Idle/Stop hook never arrived. Emits synthetic `Idle/Timeout`, clears `turnActive`. Bypasses the stability window (the 180s already debounced any flicker). Anchored to the FRESHER of `lastSignalAt` and `lastPtyOutputAt` (`anchor: 'signal-or-pty-output'`, resolved in `watchdogBaseTime`). `lastSignalAt` is refreshed by every non-log-only event - including `tool_end` (a `PostToolUse` hook is proof of liveness), so a foreground tool longer than 180s that ends while the turn continues gets a fresh window instead of being force-idled the instant it ends (task #229; pinned by `session-016-false-idle-after-long-foreground-tool`). `lastPtyOutputAt` is refreshed by `markPtyOutput` (called unconditionally on every PTY chunk by the spawn flow), so a single heavy generation turn that streams output for >180s with no nested hook event and a silent status heartbeat is not force-idled either (task #246; pinned by `session-019-false-idle-tool-less-streaming-gap`). A genuinely-finished turn sits at a quiet prompt with no PTY data (a blinking cursor is xterm-rendered terminal state, not a PTY chunk), so the anchor freezes and the safety net still fires at the threshold.

**Exception while the agent is BELIEVED parked (`parkedAnchor: 'signal'`).** A parked Claude TUI keeps repainting its statusline (rate-limit / context meter, spinner) = real PTY bytes, so the `signal-or-pty-output` anchor stays fresh forever and the net never fires - the safety net is blinded by the same parked-TUI behavior. The hold narrows its anchor to `signal` (`lastSignalAt` only, ignoring `lastPtyOutputAt`) while ANY of three "believed parked" signals holds:

- `idleHintPending` - the agent reported waiting-for-input, so its repaints are noise (task #294). Paired with the heartbeat no longer refreshing `lastSignalAt` while `idleHintPending` (see [Heartbeat recovery and idle provenance](#heartbeat-recovery-and-idle-provenance)), `lastSignalAt` freezes at the last genuine hook and the 180s net self-heals a stuck `turnActive` from any cause.
- `turnForcedByHeartbeat` - the CURRENT `turnActive=true` was set by the status-heartbeat's `forceThinking(sessionId, true)` (output-token growth while idle) and has not since been confirmed by a real turn-initiating hook. A `--resume` resume-picker context-reload is a CLI-internal turn that fires NO turn hooks, so it can NEVER produce an `idle_hint` when it parks - the `idleHintPending` gate alone cannot help, and a chatty parked TUI (statusline repaints with no gap exceeding 180s) would otherwise pin the card ACTIVE indefinitely (task #364, the residual leg task #331 left open). `turnForcedByHeartbeat` is set only by the heartbeat's `forceThinking` call and cleared by every real turn-initiating hook, the permission-resume path, every turn-end, and every turn-ending watchdog reset - mirroring `idleAuthoritative`'s provenance discipline for the active-turn side. (The bg-shell escape hatches do not touch it: their predicate already requires `!turnActive`, so it is `false` before they fire.) The PTY tracker's `forceThinking` callers (non-hooks agents) leave it `false`, so their `lastPtyOutputAt` liveness anchor is never narrowed away.
- `retryFailurePending` - the session is in a LIVE `turn_retrying` hold (`applyRetryableFailureHold`, see "Aborted-turn recovery" Layer C above): a parked-TUI "retrying in Ns..." repaint during the retry backoff is noise the same way, and must not defer the net forever if the error turns out to be terminal (task #367). Set only by `applyRetryableFailureHold` and cleared the same way as `idleHintPending` - by every real turn-initiating hook, the bypass/hold reset, and `forceThinking`/`forceIdle`.

Any of the three freezes the anchor at the last genuine hook / output growth / retry signal, so the 180s net still fires ~180s after real activity stopped. A live long-generation turn never fires `idle_hint`, is never heartbeat-forced, and is never in a retry hold (it is thinking via a real turn hook), so it keeps the `signal-or-pty-output` anchor and the PTY keeps it alive (#246).

**Fast heal for the heartbeat-forced case (30s, not 180s).** Freezing the anchor is only half the fix for `turnForcedByHeartbeat`: `lastSignalAt` is frozen at the moment output stopped growing, but the hold still waited the general 180s from there before task #331/#364's follow-up. A hook-less `--resume` resume-picker turn is a distinct class from a genuine `idle_hint`/`retryFailurePending` parked turn - it can never receive ANY confirming hook, so once `lastSignalAt` freezes there is nothing further to wait for. The stale-thinking hold's `effectiveThreshold` therefore checks `state.turnForcedByHeartbeat` FIRST (before the `idleHintPending` short grace) and, when set, uses `DEFAULT_STALE_AFTER_HEARTBEAT_FORCED_MS` (30s) instead of `staleThinkingTimeoutMs` (180s). The anchor is unchanged (still `signal`), so this only shortens how long the net waits once frozen - a live reload that is still genuinely generating keeps refreshing `lastSignalAt` via output-token growth and never reaches the grace. The 30s value is reasoned, not empirically calibrated: it is safe because a too-aggressive heal self-corrects (the next output-growth status write re-triggers `forceThinking(sessionId, true)` via the same idle → thinking heartbeat recovery), so the worst case is a brief idle blip, not a stuck-wrong state. Reuses the stale-thinking hold's `timer:stale-thinking` trigger and `staleThinking` counter rather than adding a new one - a trace cannot distinguish the fast 30s heal from the slow 180s net except by the transition's timestamp relative to when output froze. Pinned by `session-024-fast-heal-hook-less-resume` (enabled vs. disabled-grace red-green) and `session-022-false-active-repainting-past-180s` (updated to assert the tighter 30s deadline).

### 4. Stuck-pending-tools watchdog (5 min)

Held by `pendingToolCount > 0` alone for 5 minutes. Common cause: user pressed Ctrl+C, the agent killed the bash, but `PostToolUseFailure` didn't propagate. Without this hatch the engine would be stuck in `thinking` forever - the stale-thinking watchdog requires `pendingToolCount === 0` to fire, the bg-shell holds require bg shells, and the Idle clamp only works when Idle actually fires.

Resets `pendingToolCount`, the stack, `currentTool`, AND `turnActive` (the matching Stop hook for this turn was lost along with the PostToolUse). Goes through the stability window for the same reason as the bg-shell holds.

This hold is anchored to the FRESHER of `lastSignalAt` and `lastPtyOutputAt` (`anchor: 'signal-or-pty-output'`, resolved in `watchdogBaseTime`). A long quiet foreground tool (a single test run streaming output for >5 min with no nested hook events and a silent status heartbeat) used to be force-idled here, because for hooks-based agents the `PtyActivityTracker` is suppressed and PTY data never refreshed `lastSignalAt` (task #210, empirical `stuckPendingTools: 2`). `markPtyOutput` (called unconditionally on every PTY chunk by the spawn flow) refreshes `lastPtyOutputAt`, so streaming TUI output keeps a genuinely-running tool active; after Ctrl+C / a lost PostToolUse the CLI sits at a quiet prompt, output stops, and the hatch fires 5 min after the last chunk.

### 5. Stuck-subagent watchdog (5 min)

Held by `subagentDepth > 0` alone (no pending tools, no bg shells, no permission) for 5 minutes. Because the empty-string inner-stop skip (see "Subagent depth") makes `subagentDepth` sticky, a subagent whose authoritative **named** terminal `SubagentStop` is dropped (only its ignored empty inner stop arrived) would leave depth stuck > 0 forever: every other watchdog hold gates on `subagentDepth === 0`, and the `PtyActivityTracker`'s `forceIdle` (which zeroes depth) is suppressed for hook-active agents. This hold is the only recovery. It resets `subagentDepth` (and `turnActive`) and emits synthetic `Idle/Timeout`. Anchored to `signal-or-pty-output` and capped at the long 5-min threshold, so a genuinely live subagent - which refreshes the anchor via its nested tool events and streaming output - never trips it; it fires only after a real, long silence. Disjoint from the holds above by its `subagentDepth > 0` predicate. Tallied as the `stuckSubagent` compensation counter (task #237).

**Exception while BELIEVED parked (`parkedAnchor: 'signal'` via `parkedWhen`).** Task #532 made this hold reachable during a live `turn_retrying`: the retry hold now PRESERVES `subagentDepth` instead of zeroing it, so this hold arbitrates where stale-thinking used to. Without a narrowing of its own, a parked TUI repainting "retrying in Ns..." streams real PTY bytes that would defer this net forever - exactly what #367 closed for stale-thinking. So this hold also sets `parkedAnchor: 'signal'`, but scopes it with its own `parkedWhen` predicate to `retryFailurePending` ALONE, rather than the default three-flag test used by section 3.

The narrowing must NOT extend to `idleHintPending`: an idle_hint can fire mid-subagent (task #237 / `session-018`), and there the live subagent's streaming output must keep deferring the hold. Removing `parkedWhen` while keeping `parkedAnchor` turns the pre-existing #237 guard test red, which is the mechanical proof this scoping is load-bearing rather than decorative.

The narrowing is safe because ANY non-log-only event refreshes `lastSignalAt` - the narrowed anchor itself - not just the turn-initiating ones. `tool_start` / `subagent_start` additionally clear `retryFailurePending` outright and disengage the narrowing entirely; `tool_end` and a plain `idle` refresh the anchor without clearing it. Only `idle_hint` and `subagent_stop` are log-only. So what is left to the cap is a wedged CLI emitting nothing but repaints.

Two consequences worth stating precisely, because both are easy to get wrong from the section above. The cap here is 5 min, **or the 180s `staleAfterIdleHintMs` budget once an `idle_hint` has also fired** - a `{depth > 0, retryFailurePending, idleHintPending}` combination that was structurally unreachable before #532, since the depth was already zeroed by the time any idle_hint could arrive. And the one behavior the narrowing gives up: during a retry hold, a subagent producing PURE PTY output with zero hook events no longer defers the net. See "Aborted-turn recovery" Layer D, and keep the two in sync.

### Adding a new watchdog

Append to the table in `buildWatchdogHolds()`:

```ts
{
  predicate: (state) => /* what state shape qualifies as stuck */,
  thresholdMs: config.someThresholdMs,
  trigger: 'timer:my-watchdog',
  anchor: 'signal', // WatchdogAnchor: which timestamp gates the deadline
  // Optional. Replaces `anchor` while the agent is BELIEVED parked, so
  // parked-TUI repaints stop deferring the net:
  parkedAnchor: 'signal',
  // Optional. Replaces the DEFAULT believed-parked test for this hold alone.
  // Default: idleHintPending || turnForcedByHeartbeat || retryFailurePending.
  parkedWhen: (state) => state.retryFailurePending,
  reset: (state) => { /* mutations to clear the hold */ },
  applyStabilityWindow: true,
}
```

The predicates partition the state space, so `findActiveWatchdogHold` returns the first match. Each hold declares its timer anchor explicitly via the `anchor` field, and `watchdogBaseTime` (plus `scheduleTimer`'s `bgShellHoldSince` maintenance) dispatches on it; a new `WatchdogAnchor` kind is a compile-time error rather than a silent fall-through.

Anchor selection has two optional overrides, both used only where a parked TUI's statusline repaints would otherwise defer a net forever. `parkedAnchor` supplies a stricter anchor to use while the agent is believed parked (stale-thinking and stuck-subagent both narrow to `signal`). `parkedWhen` replaces the default believed-parked test for that one hold: omit it and the default three-flag test applies; supply it to scope the narrowing, as `stuck-subagent` does to `retryFailurePending` alone so an `idle_hint` fired mid-subagent keeps the full `signal-or-pty-output` anchor (#237). Thresholds have the parallel pair `idleHintThresholdMs` / `heartbeatForcedThresholdMs`, selected by `effectiveThreshold`; note that a threshold override and an anchor override are independent, so shortening one does not imply narrowing the other. The `trigger` string is only the audit-log label and the key for the compensation-counter tally. The two bg-shell holds share both `trigger: 'timer:bg-shell-hatch'` and `anchor: 'bg-shell-hold-since'`, so they behave as the same hold class with different thresholds. If a new hold's predicate could overlap an existing one, mind the table order.

## Heartbeat recovery and idle provenance

For a pure-`hooks` agent (Claude) the `PtyActivityTracker` never fires, so the status-file heartbeat is the ONLY force-thinking path. `SessionTelemetry.processStatusUpdate` runs on every `status.json` change: if the engine is idle and the agent's cumulative **OUTPUT** tokens (`contextWindow.totalOutputTokens`) grew while idle for >1s, it calls `forceThinking` - the agent silently resumed generating. Output only, never input: Claude's `totalInputTokens` is current context-window occupancy (cache + input) that climbs while parked at the prompt with no generation, so summing it would false-flip a correct idle to thinking on a parked session (#295 / #297, fixed by the output-only compare in #298).

Output-only is necessary but not sufficient. A parked session still ticks `total_output_tokens` upward on background, non-turn housekeeping (compaction / summarization) emitted with NO turn-start hook, and the heartbeat read that as "resumed generating" and pinned a parked agent ACTIVE (task #294). So the engine records **idle provenance** on `SessionEngineState.idleAuthoritative`:

- **Authoritative** (`true`): the idle was entered via a genuine hook turn-end - a non-permission `Idle` hook, an `idle_hint` that cleared `turnActive`, `Interrupted`/`TurnFailed`, or a `turn_retrying` whose turn had already wound down (`idleHintPending`) or ended (`!turnActive`), which the engine treats exactly like a terminal `TurnFailed`. "The agent told us the turn ended." Set at those source sites in `processEvent` (the synthetic watchdog `Idle/Timeout` is excluded), and out of band by `markIdleAuthoritative` (see below), the one writer outside the hook stream.
- **Fallback** (`false`): the idle was entered via a watchdog hatch resetting a stuck holder, via `forceIdle`, or it is a brand-new never-started session. "We only guessed the turn ended."

The heartbeat may force-think ONLY on a non-authoritative idle (`!state.idleAuthoritative`). This kills the housekeeping-re-activates-a-parked-agent class while preserving the net's real job - recovering a fallback idle whose agent is actually generating (a dropped turn-start hook leaves a non-authoritative idle, so the net still fires). The trade is a rare, self-correcting false-IDLE (a fully-hook-dropped new turn after an authoritative idle shows idle until any hook lands) for eliminating the common false-ACTIVE pin. Pinned by the real-capture fixture `tests/fixtures/replay/session-020-false-active-parked-housekeeping` (asserts `forceThinking: 0` across the parked output growth) and the provenance unit tests.

One caller asserts provenance from OUTSIDE the hook stream. The ORDINARY settings-change restart (`restartSessionForSettingsChange` called with no `resumePrompt`) respawns with `--resume` under a contract of "no prompt, no auto_command", but the CLI's resume-picker context reload is an internal turn that fires no hooks while growing `total_output_tokens` - exactly the shape the heartbeat force-thinks. So a ContextBar model switch painted a parked agent `thinking` for a fixed 30s (`DEFAULT_STALE_AFTER_HEARTBEAT_FORCED_MS`). `ActivityEngine.markIdleAuthoritative(sessionId)` (reached through `SessionManager` and `SessionTelemetry`) sets the flag on an already-idle session without committing a transition, asserting only what the restart already guarantees. It is the one writer that is neither a turn-end, a `forceIdle`, nor a watchdog hatch, and it no-ops silently on three conditions: the engine is disposed; the session has no engine state yet (a respawn still `queued` behind `SessionQueue` has not reached `initSession`, so that resume is **not** covered and can still be force-thought); or the session is not idle (a fresh-intent respawn is seeded `thinking`).

The SAME function is also rung 3 of the auto_command delivery ladder, called with a `resumePrompt` so the command rides the spawn as the CLI's prompt argument (see [Command Injection](command-injection.md)). That call deliberately SKIPS the assertion (`if (resumedSessionId && !options.resumePrompt)`): a resume carrying a prompt starts a real turn, so claiming the session is authoritatively idle would be a lie, and the heartbeat force-thinking it is then correct rather than the bug described above.

The heartbeat's `markThinkingSignal` keep-warm - which refreshes `lastSignalAt` so a genuinely-thinking session survives the 180s stale-thinking watchdog - fires only on **proof of work**: OUTPUT tokens grew since the previous status write, AND no `idle_hint` is pending. Each condition closes a distinct false-ACTIVE pin, both caused by parked-TUI statusline churn re-blinding the (`signal`-anchored) net:

- **The `idle_hint` gate** stops the churn after a real turn ends - the agent reported waiting-for-input, so its repaints are noise (task #294).
- **The growth gate** handles the case with NO `idle_hint` at all. A `--resume` resume-picker reload is a CLI-internal turn that fires no turn hooks, so when it finishes and Claude parks, no `idle_hint` ever arrives and the idle-hint gate cannot help; only frozen-output detection stops the churn from re-warming `lastSignalAt` forever and starving the watchdog (task #331). Live generation keeps re-warming because output keeps growing (and foreground streaming keeps `lastPtyOutputAt` fresh regardless, #246). Pinned by the real-capture fixture `tests/fixtures/replay/session-021-false-active-resume-picker` (asserts the stale-thinking net self-heals to idle) plus the `#331` unit tests in `session-telemetry-activity-decisions.test.ts`.

`markThinkingSignal`'s growth gate closes the SIGNAL-re-warm leg of the resume-picker scenario, but a chatty parked TUI whose statusline repaints never leave a gap over 180s still pins the stale-thinking net's `signal-or-pty-output` anchor via `lastPtyOutputAt` indefinitely - the PTY-output-ANCHOR leg (task #364). The heartbeat's `forceThinking(sessionId, true)` call (the one immediately above, "resumed generating") is the ONLY caller that records `turnForcedByHeartbeat` provenance; the stale-thinking watchdog reads it to narrow its own anchor to `signal` for a hook-less turn too, so it self-heals ~180s after output froze rather than ~180s after the last PTY repaint (or never, if the repaints never stop). See [the stale-thinking watchdog's `parkedAnchor`](#3-stale-thinking-watchdog-180s).

## Ctrl+C user-interrupt synthesis (3s)

When the user presses Ctrl+C in a session terminal, the renderer fires the `notifyUserInterrupt` IPC alongside the regular `\x03` write to the PTY. Telemetry arms a 3-second settle timer per session. After the window, if the engine is still in `thinking` AND state is hot (`pendingToolCount > 0` OR `turnActive`), telemetry synthesizes an `Interrupted` event with `detail: 'user-ctrl-c'`. The engine's Interrupted handler clears all counters and commits idle immediately.

If Claude's hooks already recovered the engine state during the settle window, the synthetic is a no-op (state isn't hot). Multiple rapid Ctrl+C presses collapse to one - the existing timer is cleared and re-armed each time.

Without this path, hook-drop scenarios on Ctrl+C have to wait for the 5-minute stuck-pending-tools watchdog to fire.

## BgShellWatcher (the primary natural-exit mechanism)

Empirical analysis of ~50 production sessions found:
- ~206 `background_shell_start` events
- ~4 `background_shell_end` events (KillBash)
- 0 `BashOutput` tool calls

Conclusion: agents almost never explicitly end their bg shells. The only reliable signal is OS process-tree observation.

### How it works

The watcher polls every 2 seconds. For each session with `activeShellCount > 0`:

1. Check if the Claude CLI's root PID is alive. If dead, fire `onRootProcessDied` (engine forceIdle).
2. Enumerate the Claude CLI's descendant processes via `ps` (POSIX) or `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` (Windows).
3. **Tier A (PID-aware):** when a named bg shell's OS PID is known (captured by tree-diff or the foreground-tool memo, see below), the watcher (a) fires `onShellPidExited(shellId)` → engine removes by id when the PID leaves the descendant tree, and (b) confirms liveness via `onShellsObservedAlive` → `markBackgroundShellsAlive` whenever every tracked named shell's PID is still present and there are no anonymous shells - even when the Tier B count is out of sync. This churn-proof liveness is what holds a backgrounded `npx playwright test` active while it spawns and kills its own app-under-test shells (tasks #210/#212).
4. **Tier B (count heuristic):** filter descendants to "shell-like" basenames (bash, sh, cmd, pwsh). If the topmost shell-like count dropped below `preExistingHelpers + tracked` for 2 consecutive cycles AND no foreground tool is pending, fire `onNaturalExit(delta)` capped at the engine's ANONYMOUS count. Named shells are deliberately excluded from the count-based (anonymous) drain (the engine's ambiguity guard refuses an anonymous decrement against a named shell anyway); they are governed by Tier A PID-exit, the transcript drain (a tracked shell's own terminal `<task-notification>` observed directly in the durable session transcript, see below), the output-quiescence reclaim (a PID-less named shell whose output froze while it shows a persistent deficit, see below), and the 5-min named cap as the final backstop.

**PID capture.** Tier A used to be dormant. It is now populated agent-agnostically: `SessionTelemetry.ingestEvents` calls `bgShellWatcher.noteBackgroundShellStarted(sessionId, shellId)` on every `background_shell_start` whose detail is id-shaped. The watcher resolves the OS PID two ways: (a) the **foreground-tool memo** - while a foreground tool runs (`pendingTools > 0`) the watcher remembers a single new shell-like PID, and adopts it immediately when that tool auto-backgrounds (the common case, where a fresh tree-diff would be ambiguous by promotion time); (b) **tree-diff** - on the next cycles, a topmost shell-like descendant that is neither a known helper (`helperPids`) nor already tracked, when unambiguous (exactly one candidate), is that shell's PID. Ambiguous or lagging captures retry a few cycles then give up, falling back to the count heuristic + 5-min cap.

**Transcript drain (definitive, task #386).** Before falling back to output-file heuristics at all, the watcher asks the agent adapter directly whether a tracked, PID-less named shell's terminal state is recorded in the agent's own durable session transcript: `AdapterRuntimeStrategy.backgroundShells.reportTerminatedShells({ cwd, agentSessionId, shellIds })` returns the subset of the given `shellIds` whose terminal `<task-notification>` has appeared. A block counts as TERMINAL when it carries a terminal `<status>` (`completed`, `failed`, `killed`, `cancelled`, `aborted`, `stopped`) or - for a `Monitor` that reached its `timeoutMs`, which carries no `<status>` at all - the `[Monitor timed out` marker inside its `<event>` element. Each `<task-notification>` block is matched in ISOLATION, bounded by the nearer of its own closing tag or the next opening tag, so a non-terminal block's `<task-id>` can never pair with a LATER block's `<status>` and drain the wrong holder; one terminal block may name SEVERAL ids (the orphan scan a new session emits lists every holder the previous session left without a completion record). For Claude, that notification is delivered to the CLI as a `queued_command` ATTACHMENT rather than a genuine user turn whenever the CLI is MID-TURN - so it fires no `UserPromptSubmit` hook in exactly the case where a drain matters (this is why the original hook-based drain, described below, never worked; it does arrive as a genuine `promptSource: "system"` user turn when the CLI is idle at delivery time, which is the case that never needed catching) - but it IS always appended to the native `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<agentSessionId>.jsonl` transcript, which the watcher tails forward-only (an early-EOF-anchor cursor: the first call for a transcript anchors at end-of-file and returns nothing, since a shell is only ever asked about shortly after it started, long before a terminal notification could exist - so history is never scanned, only new bytes). Matching captured ids against the caller's own tracked `shellIds` is what makes an unrelated notification (a subagent/Task completion, delivered as a genuine `role:user` message carrying a long-hex agent id) a structural no-match. This is DEFINITIVE and count/output-independent: it fires the moment the transcript confirms completion, regardless of process-tree state, and can never false-idle a live shell (a live shell has emitted no terminal notification). Implemented in `src/main/agent/adapters/claude/background-shell-transcript.ts`; the watcher stays agent-agnostic behind the generic callback (`reportTerminatedShellsFromTranscript` -> engine's `onNamedShellTerminated` -> `markBackgroundShellEnded(sessionId, shellId, { source: 'transcript' })`, trigger label `event:bg-shell-ended:transcript`).

**Output-file liveness (PID-free ground truth).** When a named shell never gets an OS PID (capture stays ambiguous under app-under-test churn) AND the count heuristic never reaches its in-sync branch (the churn keeps the topmost shell-like count permanently in surplus or deficit), neither Tier A nor Tier B can confirm liveness, and a genuinely-running E2E (which exceeds 5 minutes by design) false-idles at the named cap. To resolve this without process-tree heuristics, the watcher consults a second ground-truth source each cycle: the agent's own on-disk output file for the shell. Claude Code writes each backgrounded Bash's output to `<os.tmpdir()>/claude/<munged-cwd>/<session-id>/tasks/<shellId>.output`; growth in that file (size or mtime advancing since the previous cycle) proves the shell is alive and fires `onShellsObservedAlive` → `markBackgroundShellsAlive`, refreshing the cap anchor. ANY growing named shell suffices (the anchor is session-level). Growth-stopped is not an exit signal ON ITS OWN (a quiet live shell is indistinguishable from a dead one by output alone), but the watcher COUNTS consecutive no-growth cycles per shell (`quiescentCycles`); when a PID-less named shell's output has been quiescent for `NAMED_SHELL_QUIESCENT_RECLAIM_CYCLES` (~30 cycles / ~60s) AND the process tree shows a persistent deficit (the shell's OS process is gone), the named arm of the deficit branch reclaims it via `onNamedShellLikelyExited(shellId)` -> `markBackgroundShellEnded(sessionId, shellId)`. This is the dropped-`background_shell_end` orphan whose Tier A PID capture was abandoned under churn (task #225: a fast `npm run build` that auto-backgrounded while `npx vitest run` churned the tree, exited in seconds, but pinned the task `active` for ~36 min). The dual condition (quiescent AND in deficit) is the precise discriminator: it does NOT regress a live-but-churning shell (output still growing, so `quiescentCycles` resets) or a quiet-but-alive shell (process still present, so no deficit). A `Monitor` holder is covered by that same "process still present" half: its condition runs as a real shell (empirically `claude.exe -> bash.exe -> bash.exe` on Windows), and the outer `bash` is a topmost shell-like descendant, so a Monitor waiting quietly on a condition that has not yet fired contributes to `shellLikeCount` and is in sync rather than in deficit. Quiescence WITHOUT a deficit still falls through to the count heuristic and caps. The path layout is Claude-specific and lives behind `AdapterRuntimeStrategy.backgroundShells.resolveOutputFile` (the watcher stays agent-agnostic); the file stat is injectable for tests. This is now the SECOND line of defense: task #386 (a dead `npx vitest` shell held ACTIVE ~38 min because the transcript drain did not yet exist and the count heuristic kept mis-reading process churn as liveness) is what motivated adding the transcript drain above it.

### Agent-absence sweep (not an activity signal)

The watcher also hosts one tier that is NOT about background shells or activity state at all: it
retires a session whose agent CLI exited while its shell PTY survived. It lives here only because
this is the one subsystem that already holds every session's root PID and takes a shared process
snapshot per cycle. Its predicate is "no descendant that is not a console host" (deliberately not
the shell-like filter, which exists to hide an agent's `cmd.exe` launch shim), it runs on its own
60s cadence rather than the poll interval, and its remedy is a session-STATUS change routed through
`SessionManager`, not an `ActivityState` transition. Full description and guards:
[session-lifecycle.md](session-lifecycle.md#a-session-whose-agent-exited-under-a-surviving-shell).

Note the contrast with `onRootProcessDied` above, which fires when the root is GONE and forces
idle. Here the root is ALIVE and only its agent child is missing, which is why root-death detection
never caught this.

### Identity tracking and unattributable ends

A backgrounded Bash is tracked by id where possible. `PreToolUse` fires `background_shell_start` before Claude has assigned a shell id, so it counts anonymously (detail falls through to the command string). `PostToolUse` then re-emits `background_shell_start` carrying the assigned id from `tool_response` (field `shellId`, with `shell_id` / `backgroundTaskId` / `bash_id` as version fallbacks). A `Monitor` wait is tracked by id too - it has the same lifecycle shape (the tool returns a handle in ~300ms while the real wait runs for minutes) - but its id field is `taskId`, extracted ONLY when `tool_name === 'Monitor'` via the tool-scoped `extractDetailWhenTool` directive kind. The scoping is load-bearing: `taskId` is generic enough that a tool-blind extraction would repeat the Agent-completion mis-map described below. It encodes as its own wire KIND rather than a flag on `extractDetail` so a stale copy of the unbundled `event-bridge.js` rejects it via the decoder's `default` arm (a logged no-op) instead of silently ignoring the scoping and extracting for every tool. For a backgrounded Bash the engine treats that as a **promotion**: it swaps one anonymous slot for a named slot keyed by the id, keeping the total count constant, so a single backgrounded Bash is tracked once, by id - not double-counted. A `Monitor` has NO anonymous slot to promote: the `run_in_background` remap is gated `whenTool: 'Bash'`, so a Monitor's `PreToolUse` stays a plain `tool_start`. It instead follows the same route as a foreground Bash auto-backgrounded on timeout (described next): the named slot opens at `PostToolUse` while the engine closes the still-pending foreground tool matched by `tool_use_id`.

The PostToolUse remap keys on the **extracted shell-id detail** (`setTypeWhenDetailMatches('^[\w-]{1,64}$', ...)`, the id-shape regex sibling of `setTypeWhenDetailContains`), not on `tool_input.run_in_background`. This covers a second, distinct launch path: a **foreground** Bash that exceeds Claude Code's 10-minute ceiling is auto-promoted to a background shell and returns control, **without** ever carrying `run_in_background: true` (#187). Its `PreToolUse` was therefore a plain `ToolStart` (not a `background_shell_start`), so `pendingToolCount` was incremented; but its `PostToolUse` `tool_response` still carries the assigned shell id (empirically `bjosycg6w` in session `3fc0dca7`, `events.jsonl` line 20). Keying on the shell-id detail promotes it correctly, and the engine's `BackgroundShellStart` handler **closes the in-flight pending tool** matched by `tool_use_id` (the tool moved to the background rather than ending) as it opens the named shell - otherwise the orphaned pending tool would stick the session `thinking` until the 5-min watchdog. The inverse risk - a normal foreground Bash mistaken for a backgrounded shell - is structurally avoided: this `PostToolUse` `extractDetail` sources only the `tool_response` shell-id fields, so a plain completion has no detail and never remaps, and a failed Bash flows through `PostToolUseFailure` (a separate directive set). Such a named shell is then held active by the watcher's Tier A liveness each cycle it sees the bash's PID alive, and reclaimed by the Tier A PID-exit drain (or the 5-min named cap as backstop) once it exits - the exact "10-min E2E" case (tasks #210/#212).

`background_shell_end` from `KillBash` carries the id and drains the matching named slot; without an id it drains the anonymous count. A NAMED shell whose OS PID was never captured and whose `KillBash` end was never invoked (Incident A, session `f03f5e43`) is drained by the watcher instead: the transcript drain (definitive, see above) or, failing that, the output-quiescence reclaim or the 5-min named cap.

An earlier fix attempt drained this case via a SECOND `UserPromptSubmit` hook entry: Claude Code injects a `<task-notification>` user message on a backgrounded shell's terminal state, and the entry pulled the shell's `<task-id>` out of the `prompt` field and emitted `background_shell_end` with that id. This shipped as task #216's fix but turned out to be net-harmful in production (task #386, discovered from a real incident transcript): a background shell's terminal notification is delivered to the CLI as a `queued_command` ATTACHMENT, not a genuine user turn, whenever the CLI is mid-turn - so it did not fire `UserPromptSubmit` in the one case a drain was needed, and the hook never drained a real shell. Worse, subagent/Task completions DO arrive as genuine `role:user` `<task-notification>` messages (carrying a long-hex agent id, a different value from any shell id), so the hook fired on every one of those instead, each time emitting an **unattributable** `background_shell_end` - one that matches no named slot AND (if any anonymous shell happened to be live) could silently decrement it. The hook was removed; the transcript drain above (which matches captured ids against the caller's own tracked shell ids) is what replaced it - and does not have either defect, since a subagent's id was never asked about in the first place.

An unattributable end (an id-shaped `detail` that matches no tracked named shell) is treated as a no-op that bumps the `unmatchedBgShellEnd` compensation counter, rather than draining an arbitrary named shell OR falling back to the anonymous count. This bounds the blast radius of any input-layer mistake: a spurious end can never silently decrement a real shell (named or anonymous) and trigger a premature idle. Only a `detail`-LESS end (no id at all - the true anonymous-shell signal) drains the anonymous count.

### Lazy polling

The watcher only polls when at least one session has `getActiveShellCount() > 0`. Idle Kangentic = zero polls.

One caveat since exempt shells were added: `getActiveShellCount` sums them (it has to - the watcher is what confirms their liveness and drains them on exit), so a session holding only an exempt shell keeps polling every ~2s for that shell's whole lifetime while the board reads IDLE. "The watcher is polling this session" and "the board shows this session active" used to be the same fact; for `/preview`'s watcher they are not. The cost is the same one poll cycle the session would have paid anyway had the shell not been exempt, so this is a reporting nuance rather than a new expense - but do not read a quiet board as proof the watcher has stopped.

### Cross-platform

- **Windows:** `powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command "Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Select-Object ProcessId,ParentProcessId,Name | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation"`. Walks the parent map in JS. Times out at 1.5s.
- **POSIX:** `ps -A -o pid=,ppid=,comm=`. Walks the parent map in JS. Times out at 1.5s.
- **Liveness probe:** `process.kill(pid, 0)`; treats EPERM as alive (matches existing pattern).

### Kill switch

Set `KANGENTIC_BG_SHELL_WATCHER=0` to disable the watcher. The sole-holder holds remain as fallback (named shells reclaim at the 5-min cap, anonymous shells at the 30s grace), but without the watcher a genuinely-running named shell is no longer held past the cap (Tier A liveness needs the watcher).

## Resume reconciliation (deliberately none)

When Kangentic restarts mid-session the engine starts clean while the session's shell may still have living descendants. A `reconcileBgShellsOnResume` used to enumerate those at resume time and adopt them as anonymous bg shells. **It was deleted, and must not be reintroduced:** the adopted count was a phantom the engine had no way to drain, so a resumed session sat in `thinking` indefinitely (the "activity engine stays thinking on idle sessions" bug).

The resume path now adopts nothing. Any surviving shell-like descendants are instead folded into the watcher's first-cycle `preExistingHelpers` baseline, so they are treated as helpers rather than as background work - deliberately over-inclusive at resume, as `SessionWatchState.helperPids` notes. Pinned by the `performSpawn - resume path does not adopt bg shells` guard in `tests/unit/session-spawn-flow.test.ts`.

## Observability

### TaskCard hover tooltip

The activity icon on each task card is wrapped in a tooltip rendering `ActivityReasonTooltip`. Hover reveals an icon + inline label per reason kind: "Running Bash", "2 subagents active", "1 background shell", "Awaiting permission", etc.

### Activity Engine Debug Overlay (Developer settings tab)

A per-project setting under **Developer → Activity Engine Debug Overlay** enables a floating panel showing live engine state:
- Current activity + reason for each running session
- Raw counters (tools, subagents, bg shells)
- **Compensation counters** (`staleThinking`, `bgShellHatch`, `stuckPendingTools`, `forceThinking`, `forceIdle`, `unmatchedBgShellEnd`, `ignoredInnerSubagentStop`, `stuckSubagent`) - monotonic tallies of silent recovery events. In a clean session all eight read 0; any non-zero value flags a watchdog / forced transition / unattributable or discarded event that did not visibly flip the activity pill. (`ignoredInnerSubagentStop` is the benign exception: non-zero is normal on any session that ran subagents - it is the count of spurious empty-detail inner stops the engine correctly discarded.)
- Ring buffer of last 10 transitions
- **PTY chunk timeline** - bucketed PTY arrivals over the last ~120 seconds (100ms buckets) from `ActivityStatsSnapshot.recentPtyChunks`, rendered by `ActivityTimeline` alongside the watchdog deadline (`lastSignalAt + thresholdMs`). Empty in production builds where the trace recorder is dead-code-eliminated.

Polls `getActivityStats(sessionId)` every 2 seconds. Hidden by default - power users discover via Developer settings; bug reporters can enable + screenshot.

### Reading a transition trace

Each entry in `recentTransitions` (the ring of 50 returned by `getStatsSnapshot` / the MCP `kangentic_devtools_engine_state` tool; the overlay renders the last 10) carries a `trigger` label naming what caused it. The label vocabulary (`TransitionTrigger` in `src/main/activity-engine/engine/shapes.ts`):

| Trigger | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `event:<type>` | A hook event drove the transition, e.g. `event:tool_start`, `event:prompt`, `event:idle`. |
| `event:<type>:<detail>` | A hook event with a detail qualifier, e.g. `event:idle:permission` (paused awaiting approval). |
| `event:bg-shell-ended:<shellId>` | Id-keyed named drain - the watcher saw a named shell's OS process leave the tree (Tier A PID-exit), OR reclaimed a PID-less named shell whose output froze while it showed a persistent process-tree deficit (output-quiescence reclaim). |
| `event:bg-shell-ended:transcript` | Definitive drain - the watcher observed a tracked shell's own terminal `<task-notification>` directly in the durable session transcript (task #386). Fires independent of process-tree count or output-file state; distinct from the Tier A / quiescence label above even though both are id-keyed. |
| `event:bg-shell-ended:watcher` | Tier B count-heuristic drain - an anonymous shell reclaimed by the descendant-count drop. |
| `event:bg-shells-adopted` | Resume reconciliation adopted living descendants as anonymous shells. |
| `force-thinking` | PTY tracker / heartbeat recovery forced thinking (predicate saw no holder). |
| `force-idle` | PTY silence timer, Esc, or shutdown forced idle. |
| `timer:stability` | The 400ms idle stability window expired and committed a pending idle. |
| `timer:bg-shell-hatch` | A bg-shell sole-holder hold fired (named 5-min cap or anonymous 30s grace; same label, different threshold). |
| `timer:stale-thinking` | The stale-thinking watchdog fired (`turnActive` held alone, matching Idle never arrived); 180s cap, or the 30s `staleAfterHeartbeatForcedMs` budget when the turn was heartbeat-forced (`turnForcedByHeartbeat`, a hook-less `--resume` turn - see "Fast heal for the heartbeat-forced case" above). |
| `timer:stuck-pending-tools` | The stuck-pending-tools hatch fired (orphaned `tool_start`, lost `PostToolUse`); 5-min cap, or the 180s `staleAfterIdleHintMs` budget when an `idle_hint` was pending. |
| `timer:stuck-subagent` | The stuck-subagent hatch fired (`subagentDepth` held > 0). Two causes: a named `subagent_stop` was dropped after its empty-detail inner stop was ignored (#237), or a wedged CLI never resumed during a live retry hold that preserved the depth (#532). 5-min cap, or the 180s `staleAfterIdleHintMs` budget when an `idle_hint` was pending. |
| `interrupted` | An Interrupted event (Esc / Ctrl+C, real or synthesized) reset all counters. |
| `event:turn_failed:<error>` | A `turn_failed` event (Claude `StopFailure`, a TERMINAL service/API error) reset all counters and committed idle; `<error>` is the error type (e.g. `authentication_error`). |
| `event:turn_retrying:<error>` | A `turn_retrying` event (Claude `StopFailure`, a TRANSIENT auto-retried error). Held the session `thinking` (`applyRetryableFailureHold`) if the retry was live, or committed idle (`applyInterruptedBypass`) if the turn had already wound down / ended; `<error>` is the error type (e.g. `server_error`). |

Each transition also carries an optional counter-delta string (`formatCounterDelta` in `engine/counter-snapshot.ts`) summarizing what shifted across the mutation: `"tools +1"`, `"subagent +1"`, `"bg -1, turn no"`, `"perm yes"`. Numeric counters render as a signed delta; booleans (`turnActive`, `permissionPending`) render as the new value (`yes` / `no`); the string is `undefined` when nothing observable changed.

### Trace capture and replay (dev only)

`src/main/activity-engine/trace-recorder.ts` is a dev-only passive recorder that writes two per-session JSONL files to the session directory:

- `pty-chunks.jsonl` - one `{ts, length}` line per PTY chunk arrival (no content, just timestamps and sizes)
- `status-deltas.jsonl` - one `{ts, ...usage}` line per `status.json` update

Both files rotate at `TRACE_FILE_MAX_BYTES` (10 MB) with one rotated copy kept (`.1` suffix), capping per-file disk use at ~20 MB. The recorder is always-on in dev so the data is there when a flip-flop or stuck-thinking report comes in after the fact; production builds eliminate the entire module via `__KANGENTIC_DEV__` esbuild dead-code elimination.

The dev-only `kangentic_devtools_capture_trace` MCP tool reads these alongside `events.jsonl` to produce a portable replay fixture. The `activity-engine-trace-replay.test.ts` suite drives captured traces back through the engine to pin expected end-state.

### Invariant property testing

`tests/unit/activity-engine-property.test.ts` uses fast-check to generate random event sequences and assert invariants the engine must preserve:
- Counters never go negative
- `activity` always matches `reason.kind` per the priority ladder
- `dispose` is idempotent
- Multiple sessions stay isolated (event delivery to session A does not perturb session B)

The fuzz tests complement the deterministic replay fixtures by exercising input shapes the recorded sessions never produced.

## Synthetic events

The engine itself emits synthetic events into the activity log via the `onSyntheticEvent` callback for two cases:

- **Watchdog Idle/Timeout:** when ANY of the five watchdog holds fires - `onTick` emits this uniformly for whichever hold `findActiveWatchdogHold` matched, before dispatching to that hold's compensation counter. That is the 180s stale-thinking watchdog, either bg-shell sole-holder hold (5-min named cap or 30s anonymous grace), the 5-min stuck-pending-tools hatch, or the 5-min stuck-subagent hatch. Pushed BEFORE the matching `onActivityChange` so the log entry appears before the state change.
- **Natural-exit `BackgroundShellEnd`:** when the watcher infers a bg shell exited naturally. Detail is `IdleReason.NaturalExit` for `onNaturalExit` (anonymous count drain), or the shell_id for `onShellPidExited` (Tier A PID-exit) and `onNamedShellLikelyExited` (a PID-less named shell reclaimed by output quiescence in a persistent deficit).

## Test infrastructure

Four test tiers:

1. **Unit** (`tests/unit/activity-engine.test.ts`, `bg-shell-watcher.test.ts`, `process-tree.test.ts`): direct engine + watcher tests with mock probe. Two parity guards ride alongside them: `activity-stats-snapshot-parity.test.ts` (the snapshot's engine and IPC copies) and `no-activity-hold-sentinel-parity.test.ts` (the no-activity-hold flag's three hand-duplicated copies).
2. **Property** (`tests/unit/activity-engine-property.test.ts`): fast-check generates random event sequences, asserts invariants (counters never negative, activity matches reason kind, dispose is idempotent, multi-session isolation).
3. **Replay** (`tests/unit/activity-engine-replay.test.ts`): drives sanitized real production `events.jsonl` files through the engine and pins expected end-state. Fixtures live at `tests/fixtures/replay/`. Sanitization helper at `tests/fixtures/replay/_sanitize.mjs`.
4. **E2E** (`tests/e2e/background-shell-idle.spec.ts`): real Electron + mock Claude CLI exercising the full pipeline with actual bg processes.

## Configuration

### `ActivityEngineOptions`

```ts
interface ActivityEngineOptions {
  bgShellEscapeHatchMs?: number;     // default 5 * 60_000 (stuck-pending-tools hatch AND named bg-shell cap)
  bgShellOnlyGraceMs?: number;       // default 30_000 (anonymous bg-shell sole-holder grace)
  staleThinkingTimeoutMs?: number;   // default 180_000
  staleAfterIdleHintMs?: number;     // default 180_000 (stuck-subagent / stuck-pending-tools grace while idle_hint pending)
  staleAfterHeartbeatForcedMs?: number; // default 30_000 (stale-thinking hold, heartbeat-forced turns only)
  idleStabilityWindowMs?: number;    // default 400
  now?: () => number;                // testability
}
```

Plumbed through `SessionManagerOptions.activityEngineOptions` for tests.

### Per-project setting

`developer.activityDebugOverlay: boolean` - enables the debug overlay for the current project. Default false.

### Environment variables

- `KANGENTIC_BG_SHELL_WATCHER=0` - disables the bg-shell process-tree watcher (fallback to the sole-holder grace only).
- `SKIP_PROCESS_TREE_PROBE=1` - skips real-OS probe smoke tests in CI environments without `ps`/`pwsh`.

## History

The current design (v2) replaced a v1 three-guard state machine that had grown to 557 lines with overlapping concerns: Guard 1 (suppressSubagentWakeDuringPermission), Guard 2 (deferStopUntilSubagentFinishes), Guard 3 (deferStopUntilBackgroundShellsFinish), composite hand-off bookkeeping, a 45s stale-thinking watchdog, a 10-min Guard 3 escape hatch, and a `pendingPermissions` counter with depth-≥2 freeze logic.

The v2 single-predicate engine + process-tree watcher reduced this to ~600 lines total across `engine/activity-engine.ts` + `background-shell/watcher.ts` + `background-shell/process-tree.ts`, with a near-100% empirical hit rate on the natural-exit cases that motivated the rewrite.

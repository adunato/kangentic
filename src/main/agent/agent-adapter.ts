   * Optional: notify the adapter that per-cwd data must move from `oldPath` to

   * by the absolute cwd path, must migrate it here so sessions stay resumable
   * after the path changes (Claude renames its `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`
   * transcript directories and rewrites the matching `~/.claude.json` keys).
   *
   * Invoked for two relocations, both with the same (oldPath, newPath) contract:
   * 1. A whole-project move - called best-effort by `relocateProject` after the
   *    stored DB paths are rewritten and `git worktree repair` has run, while the
   *    project's sessions are suspended and before the renderer reopens it. Here
   *    the paths are project roots, and the implementation also migrates every
   *    worktree found under them.
   * 2. A single worktree-cwd rename - called best-effort on the first resume after
   *    a task's worktree directory was recreated at a new path (see
   *    `transition-engine/resume-cwd-migration.ts`). Here the paths are one
   *    task's old and new worktree directories, so only that cwd's data moves.
   *
   * Implementations must be internally fault-tolerant: a failure must never block
   * the caller, and must degrade to leaving data in place (never destructive).
   * Because `replacePathPrefix` confines every rewrite to keys under `oldPath`,
   * passing a single worktree path migrates only that worktree. Adapters whose
   * per-cwd data lives inside the working directory (so it moves with it) omit
   * this method.
